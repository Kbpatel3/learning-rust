# Learning-Rust Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my `Learning-Rust` repository! This repository is a personal journey through learning Rust, a powerful and fast systems programming language. It is organized into different folders, each representing a distinct topic or concept in Rust that I am exploring.

## Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific area of Rust programming:
- **Basics:** Fundamental Rust concepts and syntax.
- **Control Structures:** Exploring loops, conditionals, and error handling.
- **Data Structures:** Implementation and usage of various data structures in Rust.
- **Concurrency:** Delving into Rust's concurrency model and parallel processing.
- **Error Handling:** Strategies for robust error management.
- **Advanced Topics:** Complex concepts such as lifetimes, memory management, and more.

## Goals
- To document my learning process as I delve into Rust.
- To provide real-life code examples for each Rust concept I learn.
- To track my progress and serve as a reference for future projects.

## Contributing
While this is a personal learning repository, suggestions and advice from fellow Rustaceans are always welcome! If you see an area for improvement or want to suggest additional resources, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
